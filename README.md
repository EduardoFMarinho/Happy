# Happy

In this project, I'm developing a small system where you have access to a map listing nearby orphanages registered by the Admin. Orphanages can be clicked for more information, such as name, photos, contanct, and etc.

For this project, I'm currently using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

# Getting Started

In order to open and edit this project, you need to have a Code Editor installed in your PC. Once that is done, download the file and open it in your editor. If you have Visual Code Studio, you can right click the file and select the "Open with Code" option.

# Features (API/Library)

- WhatsApp's API for the contact number. Meaning that people can text you via WhatsApp right away just by clicking the contact button.
- Leaflet (JavaScript Library) is currently being used for the map, where orphanages will be listed. Later on, it will be able to get your location.
